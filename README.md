# E-Cert-Dapp
 ## Introduction

 ### Checks:
 - Only registered user (educator/ verifier) can register certificates , issue certificates, be issued certificates or view certificates.
 - The certificate which is to be issued, must be registered first.
 - No single user can register twice.

 ### Users:
There are 3 types of users the system provides support to:

 - Educator: This is the certifying authority, which registers new certificates, then issues the desired recipient that certificate.
 - Student: This is the recipient of the certificate. It first registers itself in the system, then sends its address to the issuer, to get the certificate issued.
 - Verifier: This can be any anonymous user, which wants to verify the recipientâ€™s certificate.

 ### Events:
Events are the logs of all the transactions done in the blockchain. So for every function of the smart contract, we log its details in events. Our system tracks these events:

 - HashAdded: logs details of every hash added to an address registered.


## Technology stack:

 - Truffle (development framework for dapps based on the Ethereum blockchain: https://truffleframework.com/),
 - Ganache (one click, in-memory blockchain: https://truffleframework.com/ganache),
 - Solidity (contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/),
 - Web3.js (Ethereum JavaScript API: https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/),
 - NodeJS (JavaScript run-time environment: https://nodejs.org/en/),
 - Angular (TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations: https://angular.io/).

 ## Set Up
 ### Install truffle
  - Run the command `npm install -g truffle`
  - Git clone the E-cert-Dapp repo
  - Cd into the directory and run ` yarn install`
  - Run ` yarn run compile` to compile the smart contract
  - Run `yarn run migrate` to migrate the contract. `truffle deploy` is an alias for `truffle migrate`. They both do the same thing.
  - Run `yarn run console` to interact with the smart contract on the ganache ethereum blockchain

  ### Install Ganache
 - Go to https://truffleframework.com/ganache and download a version dedicated to your operating system.
 - Install by a double click, then run.
 - Ganache runs with default values which should be the same or similar to these on-screen. The crucial part is a section defining RPC Server.
 - Leave it running.

 ### Install Nodejs
 - To download Nodejs, navigate to  navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and click the version that suits your machine
 - After downloading it, click the installer to get it installed on your machine
 - Verify installation by running the command on your CLI ` node -v`
 - You can use npm or yarn for package management
