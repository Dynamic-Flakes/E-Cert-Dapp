# E-Cert-Dapp
 ## Introduction

 ### Checks:
 - Only <b>educator</b> can register certificates and issue certificates.
 - The certificate which is to be issued, must be registered first.
 - No single user can register twice.
 - No hash of a certificate can exist more than one

 ### Actors:
There are 3 types of actors the system provides support to:

 - <b>Educator</b>: This is the certifying authority, which registers new certificates, then issues the desired student that certificate.
 - <b>Student</b>: This is the recipient of the certificate. It first registers itself in the system. He request for a certificate after a course is finished and the stored on-chain
 - <b>Verifier</b>: This can be any anonymous user, who wants to verify the student's certificate.

 ### Events:
Events are the logs of all the transactions done in the blockchain. So for every function of the smart contract, we log its details in events. Our system tracks these events:

 - <b>LogNewHashStored</b>: Ths event is triggered when a hashed is stored on-chain. It logs details of every hash added to an address registered.

### Process Flow:
 - <b>Issuing</b>: This is the process of receiving and generating certificate hash on the ui. Certificate will be received from the frontend, a unique hash (ie that represents the fingerprint of the certificate) will be generated by the hash-generator function
 - After hash generation, a call to a function on the smart contract to ensure this hash is stored on the
blockchain will be made
 - When this occurs, the UI also sends an email to the student with a hash of the certificate.
 - <b>Sharing</b>: this is the process by which the student of a certificate shares that certificate with a third-party.Simple way to share is that once given a hash to the student, the student can send his or her certificate to
their verifier via mail

 - <b>Verification</b>: this is the process by which a third-party verifies the authenticity of the certificate.
 - Once the verifier receives the student certificate, they upload it to the UI for verification. The frontend calls on a function in the smart contract in order to verify that the hash was authenticated by the university.
 - The true/false boolean result is then displayed on the frontend,
in the verifying window

 ## Set Up
 ### Install truffle
  - Run the command `npm install -g truffle`
  - Git clone the E-cert-Dapp repo
  - Cd into the directory and run ` yarn install`
  - Run ` yarn run compile` to compile the smart contract
  - Run `yarn run migrate` to migrate the contract. `truffle deploy` is an alias for `truffle migrate`. They both do the same thing.
  - Run `yarn run console` to interact with the smart contract on the ganache ethereum blockchain

  ### Install Ganache
 - Go to https://truffleframework.com/ganache and download a version dedicated to your operating system.
 - Install by a double click, then run.
 - Ganache runs with default values which should be the same or similar to these on-screen. The crucial part is a section defining RPC Server.
 - Leave it running.

 ### Install Nodejs
 - To download Nodejs, navigate to  navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and click the version that suits your machine
 - After downloading it, click the installer to get it installed on your machine
 - Verify installation by running the command on your CLI ` node -v`
 - You can use npm or yarn for package management

### Testing Results
- Open a terminal and run:
 `truffle test or yarn run test`
